## Key Insights

### 1. Sales Channel Performance
Samsung Store and E-commerce Platform generated the highest revenue. Samsung has a well-balanced multi-channel distribution strategy with no heavy reliance on a single channel. Slight optimization in higher-performing channels like Samsung Store and E-commerce could improve total revenue.

### 2. Return Analysis
Galaxy Z showed the highest return rate (~10.87%). High return rates in Galaxy Z may indicate product complexity, pricing dissatisfaction, or customer expectation mismatch. Investigation into quality issues or customer education strategy may reduce return costs.

### 3. Discount Impact
Most revenue was generated from orders with 0–10% discount. Revenue concentration in low-discount segments suggests strong brand pull. Increasing discount beyond 10% may erode margin without significantly boosting volume.

### 4. 5G vs Non-5G
Despite market push toward 5G, non-5G devices still dominate revenue contribution. Pricing or market penetration strategy for 5G may need re-evaluation.
